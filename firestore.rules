/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Lotomania Master application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user can only
 * access their own data, ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Games, templates, uploads, and download history are stored in user-specific subcollections
 *   under `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All write operations are validated against the authenticated user's ID to prevent
 *   impersonation and data manipulation.
 * - Data consistency is enforced by validating that the `ownerId` field in subcollection
 *   documents matches the `userId` in the path.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data model denormalizes ownership by including an `ownerId` field in documents within
 * user-specific subcollections. This avoids costly `get()` calls to verify ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The use of user-specific subcollections ensures that all data within a given path has
 * the same security posture (owner-only access), simplifying rules and improving performance.
